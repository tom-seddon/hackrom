# Hackrom

Handy utility ROM for the BBC Micro. Not very useful so far, but in
the long run it'll be buildable on your PC, and so on.

## Licence

From the original readme:

> This code is copyright 1993 by James Bonfield and Stephen Youell.
> You may copy and distribute copies of this source code provided that
> this copyright notice stays intact and that it is distributed
> without charge. You may modify this code and redistribute provided

> mutilation caused by use of the code ;-)

I'll try to figure out which standard open source licence this is
closest to.
